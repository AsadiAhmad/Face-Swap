# Face-Swap
This project performs high-quality face swapping between two portrait images using facial landmark detection, Delaunay triangulation, affine transformation, and OpenCV's seamless cloning. The result is a naturally blended face swap that preserves identity while adapting lighting and skin tone seamlessly.
